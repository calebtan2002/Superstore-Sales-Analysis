# Superstore Sales Analysis
## Overview
This project involves analysing the Superstore dataset, available on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final/data, to generate actionable insights about sales, profitability, and customer behavior. The dataset has been processed using SQL queries integrated with Python's SQLite library, and the results have been visualised in a comprehensive Tableau dashboard (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/caleb.tan7874/viz/SuperstoreSales_17353218471380/Dashboard1).

## Project Objectives

- Utilise Python's SQLite library and conduct SQL queries for data processing and analysis
   
- Analyse the Superstore dataset to uncover key insights and provide actionable recommendations to enhance sales performance

- Create an interactive dashboard in Tableau to present the results

## Workflow
### Step 1: Data Preprocessing
- Imported the dataset into an SQLite database using Python.
  
- Conducted data cleaning to ensure consistency 

### Step 2: SQL Analysis
- Ran SQL queries to uncover any trends and interesting finds

### Step 3: Visualization
- Exported SQL query results for visualisation.
- Built an interactive Tableau dashboard:

## Tools used
- SQL: For querying and analyzing the dataset.

- Python (SQLite): For database management and integration with SQL queries.

- Tableau: For creating an interactive dashboard.

- Google Colab: For executing SQL queries and Python scripts.

## Future Improvements
- Automate the SQL query execution and Tableau data updates for real-time dashboards.

- Incorporate machine learning models to predict future sales trends.

- Expand the analysis to include additional datasets for deeper insights.
